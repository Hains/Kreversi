 * A Reversi (or sometimes called Othello) game
 *
 *******************************************************************
 *
 * Created 1997 by Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>. This file
 * is ported from Mats Luthman's <Mats.Luthman@sylog.se> JAVA applet.
 * Many thanks to Mr. Luthman who has allowed me to put this port
 * under the GNU GPL. Without his wonderful game engine kreversi
 * would be just another of those Reversi programs a five year old
 * child could beat easily. But with it it's a worthy opponent!
 *
 * If you are interested on the JAVA applet of Mr. Luthman take a
 * look at http://www.sylog.se/~mats/
