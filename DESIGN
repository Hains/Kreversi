This file describes the overall design of KReversi.  Some of the
classes have different names at this point, but that is indicated by a
(now: XXX) tag.  Almost all of the classes hold more members than are
mentioned here, but those are implementation details and would only
obscure the overall picture.  This file is only to give a helicopter
view of the program, not to serve as detailed documentation.


Classes
=======

ReversiPosition (now: Position)
    Holds a Reversi position.  This is the object that implements the
    Reversi rules.


ReversiMove (now: Move)
    A move in a Reversi game.  


ReversiGame (now: Game)
    Holds all the moves of the game being played.  
    Contains: ReversiPosition	Holds the current position.
              Move[60]
    FIXME: Remove the ReversiPosition and let it be implicit?
    FIXME: Implement variations (later)


Engine
    Can generate a move, given a ReversiPosition.


KReversiGame (status: PLANNED)
    The "document" for KReversi.
    Handles a game being played and sends signals to all its views
    when something changes.  Basically, the only difference between
    this class and the more basic ReversiGame is that it sends signals
    to the views.
    Contains: ReversiGame	The actual game being played


KReversiBoardView (currently class Board)
    A view for a Reversi board.
    Contains: *KReversiGame	(not owner)
              Widgets		(owner)
    FIXME: Part of the game view is implemented in the class kreversi,
	   among other things the current score and side to move.
    FIXME: Enhance the view with timing information, move list, clock,
	   etc.


KReversiGameView (status: PLANNED)

    Shows a view of a complete game.  This will, among other things,
    consist of a list of moves, the current score, etc.
    Contains: *KReversiBoardView
              Other widgets.


KReversi
    The main class for the KReversi program
    Contains: *KReversiGame 	(owner)
	      *KReversiGameView (owner)
	      *Engine           (owner)
              View widgets - some of the part of the view, e.g. the score.
    FIXME: Let the class also own two players.


EngineView (status: PLANNED)
    View of the internal thought processes of an Engine (trace, etc).
