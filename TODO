TODO-list for KREVERSI
======================

Next
----

* (from step 4 below)

* Investigate if there is something wrong with the highscore handling.
  It seems as if a game is finished before all squares are covered
  that the highscore code is never engaged.

    - Create a toggle action to toggle it on/off			done
    - Make an icon for the toggle action				--

    - Bug: legal moves don't work together with hint.
  + Show moves made during the game					DONE

  + Navigate in the list of moves					----

  + Create a new class QReversiGameView that contains the view		----
    classes currently in kreversi.cpp

PARTIALLY DONE/NOT DONE
=======================

* undo/redo
	undo works, but I'll probably do not make a redo function

* Sound support:
  I'm not happy with
  the sound files I have so if
  you have better sounds, mail them to me 
  (uuencoded). I need sounds for the following actions:
	- game won
	- game lost
	- game drawn
	- turning a piece
	- putting a piece
	- something for the hall of fame (trumpets???)
