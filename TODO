Structural enhancements

    This will let us create a QML based UI for Plasma Active

       This should be strictly about the game, using only Black/White
     + Remove all mentions of "Player" and "Computer" from the engine   ----
       This should go to KReversiView (or perhaps introduce a new
       class for that)

Documentation
