TODO-list for KREVERSI
======================

Next
----

* (from step 4 below)
  Create a new class KReversiGame, that stores a ReversiGame
  and sends a lot of signals.
    - Split out a lot of methods from the current class Board.

* Investigate if there is something wrong with the highscore handling.
  It seems as if a game is finished before all squares are covered
  that the highscore code is never engaged.

Later
-----

* network-play against human
* implement ULONG64 as a class instead of using gcc "long long int"


PARTIALLY DONE/NOT DONE
=======================

* undo/redo
	undo works, but I'll probably do not make a redo function

* Sound support:
  I'm not happy with
  the sound files I have so if
  you have better sounds, mail them to me 
  (uuencoded). I need sounds for the following actions:
	- game won
	- game lost
	- game drawn
	- turning a piece
	- putting a piece
	- something for the hall of fame (trumpets???)

DONE
====

* Complete code cleanup.

	ported a JAVA applet with good strategy from Mats Luthman
