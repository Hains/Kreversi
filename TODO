PARTIALLY DONE/NOT DONE
=======================
* undo/redo
	undo works, but I'll probably do not make a redo function

* Sound support:
  I'm not happy with
  the sound files I havem so if
  you have better sounds, mail them to me 
  (uuencoded). I need sounds for the following actions:
	- game won
	- game lost
	- game drawn
	- turning a piece
	- putting a piece
	- something for the hall of fame (trumpets???)

DONE
====
* better strategy
	ported a JAVA applet with good strategy from Mats Luthman

* end-of-game
	shown via KMessageBox

* help
	via khelpcenter

* save options
	options are saved whenever they change

* highscores

* pieces should be drawn instead of bitmaps. Will allow other 
  colors than black/white.

* animated drawing of pieces
